# CS-7641 Supervised Learning


Using two datasets, we'll produce visual aids for 5 different learning algorithms:
- Boosting (ADABoost)
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines

### Installing dependencies and running experiments

Use python 3.6.15 
 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 main.py --all
```
